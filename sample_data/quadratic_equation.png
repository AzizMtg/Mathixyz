# This is a placeholder for a sample math image
# In a real implementation, this would be an actual PNG image file
# containing a handwritten quadratic equation like: xÂ² + 5x + 6 = 0
# 
# For testing purposes, you can:
# 1. Create a simple image with handwritten math
# 2. Use any math equation image from the web
# 3. Draw an equation and take a photo
#
# The OCR service will process this and return mock data for development
